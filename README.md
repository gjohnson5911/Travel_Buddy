# Travel_Buddy
Trip planning web app
Users can create travel plans, view other user's plans, and add themselves to any user plan
Home page shows all plans, either under the user's travel plans, or other user's plans, but not both at the same time. 
Once a user has added themselves to a plan, it should show up under their plans, not other user's plans.
